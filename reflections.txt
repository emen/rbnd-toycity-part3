1. How long did you spend working on this project?
~ 2 hours

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Trying to figure out why `attr_writer` doesn't allow to assign data inside the class
```ruby
class X
  attr_writer :x
  def initialize(x)
    @x = x
  end
  def change
    # this treats x as a local variable, not instance variale
    # still not sure why, my understanding is attr_writer creates a method, in this case , `x=`
    x = 1000 
  end
end
```

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
    1. Return a cloned copy in the `all` method, so callers won't accidentally change data in the class variables.
    2. Isolate class variable (customers, products, etc) into a method to make the code more changeable if needed.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
Think through dependencies if the interaction gets more complicated
